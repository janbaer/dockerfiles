# Dockerfile Alpine

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/janbaer/alpine.svg)](http://microbadger.com/images/janbaer/alpine)

This image is my base image. It bases on Alpine in the latest version together with Node.js in its
latest version.

It's adding the user **jan**, sets the home directory and also the shell (zshell).

Additionally my **dotfiles** will be cloned and copied to the home directory.
